 Interactive form for Treehouse Techdegree

This project also includes real time form validation for the name field. Once a user has started typing it will show the Green Checkmark if there are no symbols or numbers their name.

If there is symbols and/or numbers there will be a real time error hint that tells the user the name field cannot contain symbols or numbers. There is also a real time error if the user then erases the field and leaves it blank.
